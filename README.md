curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is my total sales?"}'

# Test 2: RoAS Calculation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend)"}'

# Test 3: Highest CPC
